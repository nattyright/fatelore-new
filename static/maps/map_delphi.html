        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>
          Delphi is a vertical city. The majority of its habitat is contained in massive skyscrapers, creating a daunting skyline even when viewed from afar. This course of development was only natural, for Delphi started out as a mere Dhruva type city with limited space and resources. Thus, it had no choice but to build up.<br><br>

          As Delphi grew in power, it started expanding its territory by annexing other small scale cities, either through peaceful (but not necessarily legal) acquisition or cutthroat (but completely civil) competition. Eventually, it grew into a Cynosura type city, with almost a third of its territory a patchwork of other cities.<br><br>

          People come and go, using this city of opportunity as a springboard to realize their vision, while Delphi in turn exploits these talents to further increase its wealth and social standing in the New World. There isn’t much variety in terms of entertainment within Delphi. However, what little entertainment it does offer is polished and high class. Some would even call them extreme, which seems fitting for a city that knows no chill.<br><br>

          Of course, like many other wealthy cities, Delphi is quick to waste lots of resources on lavish infrastructures. Inland beaches, floating gardens...nature in the New World is expensive, which is exactly why Delphi never stops finding new ways to fit them into its concrete forest.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sidebar-content" data-slide="1">
        <h4>Weather</h4>
        <p>
          A large weather dome encompasses the entire city. Delphi keeps its weather mild all year long, since it grows all of its crops indoors and thus has no need for seasonal weather. Plus, keeping the weather consistent and predictable helps with the business side of things.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sidebar-content" data-slide="2">
        <h4>Residents</h4>
        <p>
          Only about half of Delphi’s residents live here permanently. The rest are only here for short-term stay, be it for business, touring, or other reasons. Delphi opens its doors to anyone, so long as they contribute to its growth...and can stay ahead of the competition.<br><br>
          
          While honest work is rewarded accordingly, Delphi’s environments are especially harsh for those seeking huge profits. Horror stories of business magnates going bankrupt are so frequent and the people are so desensitized to them that they’ve stopped making the headlines.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sidebar-content" data-slide="3">
        <h4>Culture/Religion</h4>
        <p>
          The only culture Delphi has is work culture, and the only religion it has is money. Money makes the world go round, and Delphi’s entire existence was built on it. There probably isn’t a more suitable object of worship, if the city ever decides to adopt a religion.<br><br>

          In terms of actual religion...Delphi simply doesn’t care. Since it houses more foreigners than natives (even those ‘natives’ are oftentimes people from cities it has annexed), it’s happy to let the residents practice whatever they want, so long as they don’t hamper Delphi's growth.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sidebar-content" data-slide="4">
        <h4>CityNet™</h4>
        <p>
          Delphi has temporarily synced their radio tower signals with Olympia, so that people don’t need to buy separate SIM cards for the duration of the tourney. However, their CityNet™ is still private, since it’s unwise to share their database with each other.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sidebar-content" data-slide="5">
        <h4>Leylines</h4>
        <p>
          Due to its patchwork nature, Delphi’s leylines are chaotic and bear no distinct pattern. However, due to only using the highest quality materials scavenged from other cities for expansion, Delphi’s foundation is strong and its leylines are plentiful, even at the farthest edges of the city.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sidebar-content" data-slide="6">
        <h4>Transportation</h4>
        <p>
          Despite boasting its impressive skyline, Delphi’s main choice of transportation is surprisingly humble: subways.<br><br>

          Well...it would’ve been humble, had the entire city not been raised a good 15 meters above sea level.<br><br>

          That’s right. Nomadic cities float on the ocean. There is no ‘underground’ for Delphi to dig. Therefore, the only natural solution is to build <i>upwards</i>.<br><br>

          Delphi has raised a gigantic platform 15 meters off the ground so that it has an artificial ‘bedrock’ to play with. As a result, all of Delphi’s major buildings now start at the 6th floor. What used to be floor 6 is now floor 1. What used to be floor 1 is now floor B5. Elevators are reprogrammed accordingly. Buildings with fewer than 6 floors are now part of the foundation that hold up the platform, while new buildings are constructed on top of the platform.<br><br>

          This artificial elevation also has two additional benefits. 1, Delphi doesn’t have to waste time demolishing the ugly buildings left behind by other cities before incorporating them into itself. 2, Delphi now has an incredibly easy and straightforward solution to hiding things it does not wish to see. For example, public transportation that’s a major eyesore to the rest of its sleek cityscape. For example, problematic individuals and organizations that do not fit in with the crowd. What happens out of sight is also out of mind.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sidebar-content" data-slide="7">
        <h4 class="district1">Central Business District</h4>
        <p>
          Boasting a sleek and modern landscape and equipped with all the functions of a metropolis is Delphi's heart and soul, the Central Business District. Delphi is blatant in its hunger for expansion. Business, administration, entertainment, goods and services...everything that should be expected from a Stella Maris type metropolis can either be found here already, or have been approved for construction.<br><br>

          Underneath the manmade platform of the CBD is an area intrinsic to Delphi's history: its old market square. Back when Delphi was only a Dhruva type city, it utilized its portability to the fullest and travelled the world, striking up deals with all types of cities and making bank on mass trading. Playing the middleman has paid off in time: eventually, Delphi forged enough connections that other cities started flocking to it for opportunities instead, and it gradually evolved into a full-fledged trading center.<br><br>

          Nowadays, Delphi not only trades physical goods, but intangible products as well. Namely, favors. It uses its resources and connections to help out cities in need while keeping a neutral stance. Those favors are then recorded to be used or dispensed later as leverage.<br><br>

          What happens when one breaks a favor? Well...why don’t we find out in S2 ;)
        </p>
        <h4 class="district3">Residential District</h4>
        <p>
          The residential district makes up the ring immediately outside of the CBD. Most of Delphi's residents live here, be it short-term or long-term. Houses, apartments, inns and hotels make up a large portion of the buildings in this area, accompanied by an assortment of amenities. Bordering both the busy city center and the chaotic mercantile district, the residential district can be surprisingly chill. This is probably the most 'normal' part of the city, where people can wind down and enjoy life to the fullest. 
        </p>
        <h4 class="district2">Mercantile District</h4>
        <p>
          Delphi's old market square was relegated to the peripherals of the city after the shiny CBD took over its old spot. Compared to the CBD, the current mercantile district is not as organized and not as sleek, but what it lacks in appearance, it more than makes up for in activity. Out of Delphi's 6 arms, 5 of them have been turned into trading posts, allowing other cities to dock their cargo ships and trade their goods on site. Delphi also loves playing the middleman and helps seal deals between cities that lack certain resources...all for a reasonable fee, of course.<br><br>

          Delphi also offers storage services and the disposition of goods for cities that are looking to temporarily (or permanently) get rid of certain merchandise. Its unique city structure is a huge advantage at times like this: the 5 floors' worth of its old landscape underneath the manmade platform functions as the perfect storage unit, able to fit entire ships if one can find a sizable hollow in the infill.<br><br>

          The hubbub of activity in the mercantile district exudes a chaotic charm that can't be found in the more proper city center. The cheap availability of everything under the sun attracts innumerable buyers and tourists every day. However, please be aware that outside of the CBD, nothing is guaranteed. Quality, satisfaction, safety...one is advised to always keep their wits about them.

              A slew of towers border the CBD. This is Delphi's designated farmland, where crops and livestock are raised fully indoors. Both magecraft and technology are used to carefully control each floor's growth conditions in order to give maximum yields. To date, Delphi has managed to become 75% self-sufficient on these farms alone.<br><br>

              Outside of providing sustenance, the farms have also become a popular sightseeing spot for foreigners, since even the most common livestock can be a rare sight in smaller cities.

              Delphi is surrounded by harbors and ports, which lets it juggle the large number of ships looking to dock and trade with ease. Out of the 6 of its arms, 5 are used for trade, while the 6th is used for passenger ships.<br><br>

              There are 2 ways to get into the city proper from the docks. The most common, and the 'proper' way of doing things is by taking one of the elevators that lifts one directly onto Delphi's upper platform. Those feeling adventurous can try to navigate the deserted old city underneath the platform for a subway station that goes into the CBD.

              Not all of Delphi's 'underground' has been sealed with infill. Portions of the old city remain, while suitable buildings have been repurposed into warehouses. Even entire streets are reinforced and turned into large storage units when the need arises. Apart from commerce, quite a few stragglers and organizations have also taken a liking to residing in Delphi's deserted underbelly for various reasons. As such, security is always in high demand, especially for warehouses that store valuable goods.

              Fresh produce is the market square's biggest draw. Not only does Delphi source directly from its own indoor farms, it also uses its favors to strike up deals with farming-oriented cities for a variety of imports. Small businesses also set up shop here due to the cheaper rent and sell all kinds of exotic, handmade goods.

              All that is ugly, all that is unsavory, Delphi sweeps anything unfit for public display under its manmade platform. Outside of subway tunnels and heavily guarded warehouses, Delphi's underbelly has become a breeding ground for troublemakers. The Piss Valley is a black market infamous for its data brokers. While the companies 'aboveground' still largely play by the rules, there is no such thing down here. Delphi turns a blind eye to it so long as it operates solely 'underground'.

              Hotel business is always booming in Delphi. It has no lack of short-term migrants who are only here for business or sightseeing, and the number has recently skyrocketed due to the City Grail War that is soon to take place. Some of the hotels have been reserved for Delphi's own citizens, since the city is planning to seal off a few locations to use as battle grounds for the War. All residents living in affected areas will be compensated accordingly, while all damage to their property will be fixed or replaced afterwards.

Delphi places a lot of hope on its future generations; all schools at Delphi are heavily subsidized thanks to sponsorship from local businesses. Each school adopts one of two curricula: Gen Ed with a heavy focus on the sciences, economics and public speaking, and Vocational, which focuses on raising specific talents such as the arts and in particular, magecraft. In Delphi, magecraft is treated as a skill rather than a talent, and mages are treated no differently from a commoner.
