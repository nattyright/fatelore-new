        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
          Nirvana is a nature reserve city. It is run by independent investors that are attempting to set roots in the New World, a groundbreaking concept that could potentially lead to humanity living on land once again instead of relying on nomadic cities. While this is Nirvana's primary objective, it also doubles its purpose as a tourist spot by hosting various rare animal species that have survived the apocalypse. It is very similar to a wildlife park or zoo. 
        </p>
        <h4>Size</h4>
        <p>
          Nirvana is decently large, but most of its size is dedicated to the animals and the nature reserves. Therefore, it cannot host as many inhabitants as Olympia/Delphi.
        </p>
        <h7>Writer's Note</h7>
        <p>
          For a real life reference, please look at Singapore. A horizontal trip across Singapore takes roughly 14 hours on foot. It's small enough that most places can be covered on foot, but big enough that it's extremely inconvenient without public transport. (Spoiler: there is no public transport.)
        </p>
        <h4>Weather</h4>
        <p>
          Extremely advanced weather dome systems give rise to a wide range of weather conditions to accommodate all the flora and fauna on the island.
        </p>
        <h4>Transportation</h4>
        <p>
          All public transportation (trains and only trains) have ceased operations in Nirvana. Embrace nature (and biking), they say.
        </p>
        <h4>Power</h4>
        <p>
          Wind turbines and hydropower plants reinforced by magecraft. Some inhabitants also have their own means of power generation thanks to the varied landscape.
        </p>
        <h4>Culture/Religion</h4>
        <p>
          Both Republic and the Neo Holy Empire have little to no influence on Nirvana due to it being a nature reserve.
        </p>
        <h4>Structure</h4>
        <p>
          Unlike other nomadic cities, Nirvana is a mix of both old and new. The vast majority of its platforms are held up by sea runes, due to it having merged with other cities in order to become the Cynosura that we see today. However, its core is still composed of the original Dhruva type city, albeit its blueprints don't match any of the existing Dhruva city designs that are stored in most city/Republic/Church databases.
          <br><br>
          Nirvana's core seems to be propelled by a scientific apparatus reminiscent of modern waterwheels, allowing it to move like a ship while also powering itself by using the tidal energy of sea currents. This apparatus is no longer being used for movement ever since it became a Cynosura.
          <br><br>
          Another thing of note is the lack of digital currency in Nirvana. While the city eventually adopted digital currency during the peak of its tourism, its database wasn't designed to accommodate such currencies in the early days. All signs point towards Nirvana being a fairly old city, from a time beyond the modern nomadic city standards which have been decreed by both the Church and Republic.
          <br><br>
          Funnily enough, both organizations would pay top dollar to purchase the blueprints of the city. Most likely the reason why the current investigation team was tasked to retrieve Nirvana's database.

        <h4>The Residents</h4>
        <p>
          Humans:  80,000+<br>
          Due to the large focus on tourism, it can host up to 500k inhabitants, but most people don't stay long)<br><br>

          Wildlife: 3 million+<br>
          This includes fish and insects.
        </p>
        <h4>Daily Life</h4>
        <p>
          Nirvana has been subsisting on its own produce, as well as commodities that were shipped to the island prior to 2102. Some popular stores are still manned by people, while others have been abandoned. Though many restaurants are still in operation due to Nirvana's self-sustaining ecosystem. It's common to see ransacked buildings and bustling facilities juxtaposed against each other on the same block of street. What a bizarre sight.
        </p>
        <h4>????chauvinism????</h4>
        <p>
          Permanent residents or not, the citizens of Nirvana all harbor varying degrees of hostility towards outsiders due to the influence of the mud, which had long since infiltrated Nirvana's ecosystem via the tree roots that had come into contact with the old earth.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sidebar-content" data-slide="2">
        <h4>CityNet™</h4>
        <p>
          Connections to other cities have been permanently blocked and is overseen 24/7 by engineers and Servants alike. There is no way for Nirvana to send or receive information to the outside digitally. All telecommunication remains internal.
        </p>
        <h4>Leylines</h4>
        <p>
          Leylines are abundant, albeit erratic, due to the interference of the mud.
        </p>

        <h4 class="district3">Nature Reserve: Forest</h4>
        <p>
          Danger Level: severe

          QoL: good 
        </p>
        <p>
          The north of the island is filled with thick forests and tall mountains, the perfect climate for arboreal animals or predators who prey on the latter. One will find plenty of squirrels, birds and deers, along with foxes, wolves and bears. Naturally, they are kept in separate enclosures to avoid any tension between herbivores and carnivores.
          <br><br>
          The tallest mountain in Nirvana is man made and designed to give a clear overview of the island from the very top. While initially planned to host holding cells for animals used to high altitudes, it has become a common tourist attraction for romantic couples looking to take selfies from the top of a gigantic mountain, something that is very much lacking in other cities. Of course, there haven't been tourists on the island for ages.
        </p>
        <h4 class="district1">Nature Reserve: Tropical Jungle</h4>
        <p>
          Danger Level: severe
          <br>
          QoL: fair 
        </p>
        <p>
          A tropical jungle designed to host exotic animals, ranging from monkeys to tigers and poison frogs. Since it is one of the more dangerous reserves, a lot of protective Magecraft and surfaces have been applied to the area, stopping tourists from exploring off-limits areas while keeping the animals safe from harm. Unfortunately, it seems like the system hasn't been maintained in a long while, leading to the barriers falling as animals started to prey on each other. It is recommended to approach this area with caution, lest an anaconda coil up to you and gobble you up.
        </p>
        <h4 class="district4">Nature Reserve: Swamp</h4>
        <p>
          Danger Level: light

          QoL: fair
        </p>
        <p>
          Right next to the jungle is the Nirvana swamp, though it is called wetlands on the official guide pamphlet. The wetlands host animals that require a mixture of ground and sea to live, such as capybaras or crocodiles. Due to the amount of cold blooded and peaceful animals that lived in this area, almost no defensive precautions were taken and tourists were freely allowed to interact with well-fed animals. However, that is no longer the case, as the animal feeders stopped showing up, resulting in animals cannibalizing each other. The swamp now serves as one of the more treacherous areas of the reserve, with predators hiding underneath the muddy water as they wait for a tasty snack to arrive.
        </p>
        <h4 class="district6">Nature Reserve: Snow</h4>
        <p>
          Danger Level: severe
          <br>
          QoL: harsh
        </p>
        <p>
          The frozen tundra is the heart of Nirvana's laboratories, meaning that it hosts the least amount of animals in order to give researchers peace and quiet to work on their projects. The most you will find here are penguins and seals, relatively docile animals that aren't a threat to humans whatsoever. Unfortunately, the weather dome around the tundra seems to be in a status of permawinter, meaning that temperatures are incredibly low and that people without proper equipment will suffer from frostbite in a matter of minutes. The animals also behave rather aggressively for some reason, with penguins trying to peck at people's eyes while seals attempt to shred their legs. Could this be related to the presence of the labs?
        </p>
        <h4 class="district5">Nature Reserve: Desert</h4>
        <p>
          Danger Level: light
          <br>
          QoL: fair
        </p>
        <p>
          A sizable desert that encompasses most of Nirvana's south. While manmade, it has a lot of attention to detail, to the point that one can find various oases scattered across the sand. Most animals that live here can only inhabit rocky or sandy terrain, such as camels or the desert cat. It is also not uncommon to find a high concentration of bugs and insects lurking in the sand. The animals in the desert seem to behave erratically, as if seeing anything around them as a potential threat. Caution is advised when travelling.
        </p>
        <h4 class="district2">Nature Reserve: Lake</h4>
        <p>
          Danger Level: mild
          <br>
          QoL: good 
        </p>
        <p>
          A bountiful man made lake created after the implementation of Nirvana's river and irrigation system. It hasn't been maintained in ages, but the system's self-cleaning equipment seems to be functioning to this day. The lake has a high density of fish inhabiting it, along with small woodland creatures occupying the grassy areas. Rabbits, toads and cats are very common. Unlike other animals on the island, animals residing at the lake are relatively docile and tranquil. As a result, it is somewhat of a safe haven for the investigators.

        <h4>2105-02-02</h4>
        <p>
          The third investigation team is set to arrive at Nirvana...
        </p>
        <h4>2104-11-03</h4>
        <p>
          Curiosity peaked. Investigations resumed. After putting together the information from the journal and intel from cities that have associated with Nirvana over the past few decades, it was deemed that Nirvana had been conducting dangerous research:tm:. After much preparation, a third team of investigators were dispatched. Composed of top-notch mages fully equipped with Mystic Codes and S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frames, they were tasked to uncover Nirvana's secrets, being authorized to use force if necessary.
        </p>
        <h4>2104-03-18</h4>
        <p>
          A barely functional automaton was captured by a team of librarians near the coast of Alexandria, recognized to belong to a librarian that had gone with the second investigation team. The automaton carried with it a waterlogged journal. The journal was later restored and deciphered to belong to a researcher on Nirvana belonging to the old guard. It revealed much detail on the origin and propagation of Nirvana (the timeline you are reading, up to the year 2060).
        </p>
        <h4>2103-01-14:</h4>
        <p>
          A second team of investigators were dispatched. They would meet the same fate as the first team and lose contact with their sponsors a few weeks into the journey. Investigations temporarily ceased.
        </p>
        <h4>2102-08-22</h4>
        <p>
          Communications with the team were cut. The investigators never returned.
        </p>
        <h4>2102-08-19</h4>
        <p>
          The team located Nirvana and prepared for docking.
        </p>
        <h4>2102-08-14</h4>
        <p>
          The team arrived at South Africa's coordinates.
        </p>
        <h4>2102-06-29</h4>
        <p>
          A team of investigators were dispatched to look for Nirvana according to its last known location, what used to be the Old World's South Africa.
        </p>
        <h4>2102-03-23</h4>
        <p>
          On a fateful day in the spring of 2102, Nirvana completely cut off its communications with the rest of the world. Tourists never returned from their trips. Nirvana itself has vanished from the map, with a mysterious fog remaining in its stead. Could the city still be lurking beyond that thick mist?
        </p>
        <h4>2090-2102</h4>
        <p>
          After spending several years doing further research and preparing, the science team eventually decided to go ahead with their plan. The city was set en route to South Africa, which is rumored to be the birthplace of the first humans. Upon arriving there, the preparations to spread Nirvana's roots and have it touch the ground were made. Nirvana's roots dug deeper and deeper, until it made contact with a surface.
          <br><br>
          But it wasn't Earth.
          <br><br>
          Over the next decade, communications with Nirvana gradually dwindled, and its once thriving tourism went into a steady decline…

        </p>
        <h4>2060-2090</h4>
        <p>
          Nirvana dedicated the next few decades towards its own reconstruction, focusing heavily on the tourism aspect. It converted itself into a Cynosura, hosting a larger population of citizens and tourists alike. S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frames were also delivered en masse by the city's investors.
          <br><br>
          However, some of Nirvana's more curious citizens researched the city's history and found out about its original plans of rebooting the world. Ashamed by how much the city had degenerated from its original goal, these researchers banded together to form a new science department. They pitched their idea to dig at the Earth's roots to the investors, who saw it as a lucrative business proposal and gave it the okay.

        </p>
        <h4>2035-2060</h4>
        <p>
          Advertising Nirvana as a glorified zoo proved to be successful, as tourists from neighboring cities started visiting for the novelty. Word of mouth spread, eventually turning into word of CWW as the city grew in popularity for its unique niche. This attracted the attention of financial investors, who offered to 'purchase' the city and continuously fund it as long as they dedicated more resources to the nature reserve aspect of the city.
          <br><br>
          The city was flourishing...
        </p>
        <h4>2030-2035</h4>
        <p>
          Almost three decades had passed, resulting in the city's facilities starting to show their age. Their trip to the Arctic Ocean was forever delayed, as they attempted to barter with the neighboring cities for resources.
          <br><br>
          Tensions escalated between the old guard and the new arrivals to the city. The old guard felt like they were losing sight of their honorable goal of restarting humanity, while the new arrivals thought the chances of such an ambitious plan were close to zero and that they should focus on preserving the city instead.
          <br><br>
          Eventually, both sides came to a compromise: Nirvana would advertise itself as a nature resort, using its fauna and flora as exotic setpieces to attract nomadic cities looking for entertainment. These funds would be used to maintain the city, while a portion of it would be directed towards R&D for Nirvana's original goal.
        </p>
        <h4>2014-2030</h4>
        <p>
          After obtaining more knowledge on the new world, the Nirvana crew decided to make their newfound objective be to restore land to Earth. This meant spreading Nirvana's roots towards the Earth's land, which had been sealed by the ocean itself. Therefore, the city headed over to the Arctic Ocean, where the water was most shallow. However, this trip would take decades due to the distance and speed of their city.
          <br><br>
          This resulted in several detours, with the city's original inhabitants leaving for other cities while letting newcomers stay. This resulted in Nirvana slowly losing sight of its goal, as its population grew and opinions grew more diverse.
        </p>
        <h4>2004-2014</h4>
        <p>
          Initially, there was a panic due to the apocalypse, but the higher members of staff took charge and focused on the task of rebuilding humanity and the Earth's environment and fauna.
          <br><br>
          A decade was spent on technological progress and research, with analysis dedicated towards the newly formed ocean. Attempts to communicate or track down any neighboring cities or vessels were made, resulting in Nirvana establishing contact with other nomadic cities. This allowed for the spread of information, information sharing and trading of resources.
        </p>
        <h4>2004-2005</h4>
        <p>
          Nirvana's purpose as humanity's incubator would be kickstarted early as the Grail Mud apocalypse occurred. Thanks to Atlas Institute, their nomadic city was outfitted with sea runes before the flood occurred. Nirvana survived and floated somewhere around the world.
        </p>
        <h4>2002-2003</h4> 
        <p>
          Nirvana was one of the nomadic cities built before the spread of the flood, starting off as a humble Dhruva. It had close ties with the Atlas Institute and was designed as an experimental nomadic city with the purpose of 'rebooting' humanity if the species were to ever go extinct. A modern day Noah's Ark.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sidebar-content" data-slide="5">
        <h4 class="district3">Pre-Investigation</h4>
        <p>
          <span style="color: hotpink;">William</span> has been performing at the island for several years now under the guise of Shakespeare, but every moment he spends on the island causes him to view the inhabitants with disdain. Since he is a hack compared to the real Shakespeare, people pay barely any attention to his plays and treat him more as cheap entertainment than an artisan, which drives him nuts.
        </p>
        <p>
          During this period, the researchers have begun their dig operation towards Earth's roots, albeit at a glacial pace since they are taking their time to study this uncharted territory. Their drill eventually pokes (hehe) the Earth's crust, cracking the shell and releasing the <span style="color: hotpink;">Mud</span> once more.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the water seems to have a negative effect on the Mud, forcing it to remain in the crack as it is unable to escape. Despite this, the Mud isn't content with remaining at the bottom of the ocean's abyss and attempts to send signals to whoever is willing to receive it on the surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Mud's influence, sensing William's kokoro no yami, eventually starts barraging him with visions and hallucinations (William's Master lived close to the area of the island where the digging was happening). He initially brushes them off as his inner thoughts, which lets the Mud take advantage of that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, William is lured by the hallucinations and secretly sneaks into the Nirvana main lab after being called by the Mud. It is there where he messes around with the digging tools in secret, causing the drill to dig deeper into the crust and give the Mud more breathing room to find entities to infect. Even though he witnesses its spread and never touches it, he is already mesmerized by its chaotic potential and decides to have some fun with it. (He isn't fully corrupted like the Islanders but his mind still coo coo from prolonged Mud mindfuckery exposure)
        </p>
        <p>
          The Mud eventually finds its way to Nirvana by spreading around the city's tree roots, which have been nurtured for an entire century and therefore dig rather deep, using the sea as nutrients for themselves. By disguising itself as a nutrient, the Mud infiltrates Nirvana's trees and starts to spread its contamination through them. Since the trees view the Mud as a nutrient, they release resin to preserve it, which gives it a layer of protection against Nirvana's atmosphere along with the ocean itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          William continues his schemes upon noticing the infected trees. He starts by slowly luring the researchers to the trees one by one in order to let the Mud assimilate them and grow. The Mud grows stronger, to the point that the researchers at the lab no longer need to be lured since they start getting irritated towards each other and the tourists on the island.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile William's Master notices that something is off, so William lures him to the Mud as well and kicks him in, letting the Mud eat him and freeing William of his Master's shackles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, thanks to William, the Mud's influence spreads and grows and Nirvana gets gradually more and more corrupted. This results in tourists getting kicked out/assimilated as the city goes silent.
        </p>
        <h4 class="district3">The First Investigation</h4>
        <p>
          The first investigation is a disaster because nobody expected the normal looking citizens to suddenly turn against respected investigators. Even worse, the incredibly powerful Magecraft of the investigators seems to have been neutered by a distant force, who is actually William supporting the islanders from afar with his anti-Magecraft/Fiction abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of this, even the really talented Mages fall and/or are assimilated, since they didn't expect their own 'allies' to turn into their enemies, nor did they expect the Mud to turn them against each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="color: hotpink;">Ruth</span>'s cult also starts gaining more and more traction during this period, since <span style="color: hotpink;">Verga</span> looks at her and goes ZAMN!!! :heart_eyes: She might have even plucked people from the first investigation team and indoctrinated them in her cult.
        </p>
        <h4 class="district3">The Second Investigation</h4>
        <p>
          The second investigation is more cautious, but fails all the same because of the islanders’ newfound strength. Ruth’s cultists are willing to die for her, while <span style="color: hotpink;">birdman</span> has trained his birbs to protect his territory and <span style="color: hotpink;">John Bondrewd</span> will kill anyone who even DARES to stop him from being a NEET.
        </p>
        <p>
          William slacks off because he isn't needed, except for minor support. Likewise, Verga only limits himself to observing since he cares not about whether islanders win or lose. All he cares about is some good bloodshed since it embodies the tragedy of human life, which is great realism porn for him.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the second investigation Servants, however, catches William’s eye: <span style="color: hotpink;">El Cid</span> was a Servant brought by the second investigation team and despite fighting a valiant battle, he was ultimately subdued and killed by three enemy Servants. However, instead of dying, El Cid used his fabled Noble Phantasm, since in his myth there were rumors of his wife tying up his corpse on a horse and having it charge into battle, causing a myth of a Zombie El Cid that came back from the grave to destroy his enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, when El Cid dies, he temporarily turns into a zombified ghoul version of himself and lashes at the nearby environment. However, this powerup is merely temporary and will result in his death either way. Instead of wasting this Servant, William offered himself to ‘take care’ of them aka use them as a guinea pig. He restrained the undead El Cid in a remote location on the island and started grafting various forgeries on the Servant, which severely changed its Spirit Core. He eventually morphed him into a phantasmal being that believed itself to be a completely different Servant known as <span style="color: hotpink;">Vortigern</span>, based on William’s own play.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vortigern is akin to a Phantom Spirit, being a combination of various entities such as Yan Qing or Hessian Lobo. In Vortigern’s case, he is a combination of El Cid, Vortigern from William’s play and Vortigern from historical Britain. However, due to him not being a ‘true’ summon, he is quite volatile and prone to bursts of confused anger, which corrupted his Class container into Berserker.
        </p>
        <p>
          El Cid’s conversion into Vortigern also marked the end of the second investigation, since all of the investigators were either killed, captured or worse, converted to the islanders.
        </p>
        <h4 class="district3">The Third Investigation</h4>
        <p>
          With two investigations having been disposed of, William saw no need in assisting the islanders any further and decided to tend to his own matters instead. He focused a lot on Vortigern in order to see if he was ever capable of creating something valuable, be it a play or a Heroic Spirit. He wonders if turning Vortigern into a legitimate Heroic Spirit will turn him into a legitimate author, since Heroic Spirits such as Frankenstein are their authors’ claim to fame.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the third investigation team arrives, William will attempt to act friendly towards them and avoid any direct confrontation. He has grown tired of facing opponents directly, since that is a type of tragedy he has already experienced. Instead, he would rather observe the investigators slowly crumbling into despair from the backlines, pretending to be their ally in order to get first row seats to their demise. Whether that will work or not is up for debate.

              A merch store that has been ransacked, but still holds huge amounts of stock due to how much Nirvana relied on tourism. Anything from synthetic animal fur coats to Pallas Cat undies can be found here, reminding people of better times where tacky merchandise was the only thing worth worrying about. Due to the high number of supplies, it has gathered the attention of Nirvana's Servants who currently use it as their base of operations.

            <h2>Docks</h2>
            <p>
              Right next to Nirvana's beach are the city docks, which are the only docking station that it has at its disposal. Tourists will usually reach the natural paradise here, albeit it seems like the docks haven't been looked after for quite a while. The docks are littered with abandoned ships that have traces of rust to them. Flora has started to inhabit the surface as well, with algae covering the various ship vessels that surround Nirvana. Seems like the city hasn't received any proper tourists in a while.
