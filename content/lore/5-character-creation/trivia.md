# Kara no Kyoukai

{{< details title="**Certain relics or beings that have accumulated enough history and mystery can obliterate magic formulae with the sheer crushing weight of their existence.**" open=false >}}

“Shiki, I know that’s an old piece of history. Don’t even think of pulling that out unless you want to cut down the ward around this place.” Shiki freezes as soon as she says that. “It’s impressive and all, and I can even read the Kuji: ‘let the warrior-god light my way.’ It’s cool. But the wards that I’ve put up won’t be a match for a sword with that kind of history.”\
\
...\
\
“Old swords build up their own mystery and belief around their ancient history, and so become weapons capable of even cutting spells shaped from the Art,” explains Miss Tōko. “So don’t take that thing out again. I won’t be responsible for any eldritch horrors you may unleash spiriting you away.”

# Fate/Stay Night (+Mahōtsukai no Yoru)

{{< details title="**Anything that produces it's own magical energy gains a natural amount of magic resistance.**" open=false >}}

Magi have magic resistance.\
It is the power to repel "magic" such as hypnotism, binding, and coercion.\
As long as one is a magus, one cannot be easily controlled by others.\
It's a fundamental law.\
Magi have Magic Circuits.\
The circuit in one's body does not only make magical energy, but it can also repel external magical energy.\
Therefore, it is difficult to interfere with someone with a Magic Circuit, and it is difficult even to control a magus several ranks lower than you.\
As the Magic Circuit repels external magical energy, magic is destroyed before it can be completed.\
For that reason, indirect intervention magic, such as hypnotism and binding, has a low success rate.\
Even if the target is not a magus, the magic can be repelled unconsciously if the target has a Magic Circuit.\
From that point of view, an intervention of just attacking with pure magical energy like Tohsaka does, making a weapon in this world and attacking the opponent as a result, is a simple method.\
Physical impact works on everyone.\
It does not matter if the target has a Magic Circuit or not, as people will bleed if they are cut with a knife.

{{< details title="***You can 'wash away' spells that have yet to fully form, or those composed purely of the Imaginary Element, Ether. <br> <br> This can be done for offensive or defensive purposes, but spells that have already taken hold, or those constructed more solidly with other Elements require proper countermeasures.**" open=false >}}

...My spirits weaken.\
As the magic is complete, there's no way I can dispel it.\
I can't do anything unless Caster releases me or I get some outside help-!\
"Do you get it now? It is my magic that is binding you and not my magical energy.\
A completed magic cannot be washed away by water like magical energy.\
It is just like solid and liquid. The solid does not crumble even if water is poured on it, right?"\
…The shadow steps closer to me.\
The bluish-purple robe melting into the night is smiling.\
"But there are exceptions.\
For example… Yes, the magic you people make is like mud buildings to me.\
I can wash it away with a violent water current, even if it may be a solid.\
Do you understand? The difference between us is that great."

* *Fate/Stay Night, Visual Novel, Unlimited Blade Works, Day 6*

(Still, what was it? You can combine the imaginary elements-Ether-with pretty much anything else since it's not real itself...?\
Anything composed entirely of magical energy is little more than an illusion and will quickly dissipate. Even a typical field, like a wall of thorns, generally starts with the user planting the thorns first before using magical energy to grow and strengthen them in an instant.\
In the end, magical energy is just an easy-to-use fuel source, while acting as a firework that ignites a phenomenon.)

* *Mahōtsukai no Yoru, Visual Novel, Chapter 4, Secret Resolve*

The fog that filled the corridor was no magical weaving, but rather a barrier of raw energy.\
It was equivalent to setting blaze to three buckets of gasoline to create a wall of fire, the hope it would stop an arrow in flight.

* *Mahōtsukai no Yoru, Visual Novel, Chapter 5 - Part 1, Night of Witches 3*

At the last moment, Aoko managed to thicken the magical energy running through her veins into a primitive form of magecraft resistance. It just barely saved her life from what must have been the puppet's ace in the hole.

{{< details title="**As Ghost Liners, Servants are closer in nature to spiritual beings given temporary form rather than inherently physical familiars, and as such, they can only be affected by objects and attacks with magical or spiritual attributes unless achieving physical incarnation and becoming true residents of the material plane.**" open=false >}}

"Of course it's amazing. Not just Saber, but all the Servants are heroic spirits. There's the fact that they're spirits, but they can't be hurt by normal means. That's because Servants themselves are divine mysteries.\
"The only ones that can physically hurt the Servants are other Servants, heroic spirits like them. So in other words, if a Servant was using it, even a paper knife could hurt Saber."

* *Fate/Stay Night, Visual Novel, Fate, Day 10*

"Right, next question. Are Servants still spirits even if they take physical form? So you can't hurt them with normal weapons?"\
"…Let's see. A normal Servant will be able to nullify them, but those consumed by Sakura are another matter.\
Having received bodies from Sakura, they cannot return to spiritual form.\
Strong magical weapons should be able to penetrate through their shadows."

# Fate/Zero

{{< details title="**Magic Circuits produce heat when processing magical energy.**" open=false >}}

Furthermore, in addition a specter IR heat detector scope is installed as a sideways support. This one is also electronically equipped for night vision, although the image display isn't an intensity amplifier, but displays the heat patterns of the subject. It can perceive temperature variations from -5 to 60°C up to 200 meters with an 1.8 magnification.

Having discovered that the operation of Magic Circuits changed the temperature of the practitioner, Kiritsugu had studied and trained so much that he was now able to read, through the thermal output, the current status of the Magic Circuits by viewing the heat distribution. Viewing the clear difference between an ordinary person and a magus, it is possible to seize an opportunity after the release of prana. The joint use of both bulky night vision devices is not just for night time battle, but also a configuration to specifically face against a magus.

{{< details title="**In Spirit Form, Servants do not have access to their Phyiscal Senses must rely on Spiritual Sensations.**" open=false >}}

Assassin hid in the perfect spot to observe the straightforward battle — the crane that loomed beside the cliff. The location was about 500 meters away from the site of the skirmish. As a Servant with eyesight surpassing that of a human he could clearly discern the two’s conflict, even spotting their expressions with accuracy. Meanwhile, the two combatants barely had time to consider if they were being spied upon.

He could have remained in spiritual form and obtain information from a much closer distance. But while he is in spiritual form, his senses would have turned into spiritual detection; and the job that his Master gave him tonight was to ‘observe with your eyes.'

Assassin, who understood his Master’s intentions, silently gazed at the battle in the distance according to his order.

# Fate/Apocrypha

{{< details title="**Even mundane objects, like rocks and twigs, can damage a Servant if laced with magical energy to allow for mere physical objects to affect a spiritual being.**" open=false >}}

Five eyes, located in various places on Berserker’s shoulders, neck and abdomen, all turned to glare at Archer of Red and Ruler. The two female Servants instantly separated to the left and right respectively as if flicked away. Not caring about that, Berserker of Red swung his sword with all his might.

Pieces of the ground that he blew away and smashed apart flew at Ruler and Archer like high‐explosive projectiles.

“Guh—!”

“Kuh…!!”

Rocks tore through their skin and even damaged part of Ruler’s armor. An attack without prana accompanying it could never harm a Servant. But prana had been loaded to the point of bursting into the sword he swung, and it had even contaminated the broken pieces of stone.

It was the same as a Servant throwing dirks with prana loaded into them…\
Though, it was the first time Ruler had witnessed of the phenomenon of prana clinging even to fragments smashed apart with a sword.

{{< details title="**Servants can most certainly get drunk if they choose to.**" open=false >}}

**Cursed Arm:** ...I did not know that Servants could get drunk.

**Arturia Alter:** If we want to, yes. How strange; he seems like just a harmless old man when intoxicated.

**Xquic:** One who lived as a saint would have to deny their sainthood. A warrior who refused to become a king would have to become the very sort of king they despised. To become an Alter means to betray your life, your principles, everything that makes you a Heroic Spirit, and to do so knowingly, willingly, by your own hand.

# The Case Files of Lord El-Melloi II (+Mahōtsukai no Yoru)

{{< details title="**Connecting yourself to another Mage's Magic Circuits puts you completely at their mercy.**" open=false >}}

As Luvia realized what he had done after grabbing her wrist, her eyebrows shot upwards.

"Are you connecting to my magic circuits?!"

Even just hearing those words made me shudder. Meanwhile, my master's response was to shout.

"If you're going to reject it then reject it!"

The words my master was speaking showed a demonstrable lack of sanity.

Because when connecting to someone's magic circuits, the receiver of the connection had absolute control. For a magus of even middling ability, they would easily be able to manipulate, or even burn out, the connected magus' circuits. If the whim struck her, Luvia could destroy his magic circuits from the inside out with barely a thought. Considering how magic circuits connected to the nerves of the body, it was similar to putting his live heart in her hands.

But she didn't.

* *The Case Files of Lord El-Melloi II, Volume 1, Chapter 4*

The disruption of formulae was only supposed to work on absolute beginners.\
If it had been her roommate, the arm would have been repelled the instant it hit her and the attacker's circuits burned out, rather than her own.\
Attempting to establish a link to the Magic Circuits of another mage was like presenting your heart on a silver platter. It would be of no use in a battle against a superior mage.

{{< details title="**In most cases, a Mage will always have the advantage when operating in their own Workshop and hindered when intruding on someone else's, though the extent of this effect greatly depends on the quality of the Workshop and the Mage who maintains it.**" open=false >}}

"Please, no need for bluffs," the astrologer laughed, watching Luvia with one eye closed. "I may look like a mess, but I really am an astrologer. Sure, the Edelfelt's Jewel Magic is beyond my field of expertise, but if I walk in to an astrological ritual halfway there's no way I wouldn't recognize it. Oh and don't bother being flustered about it either, this is another magus' workshop. The land and the air themselves are against us. I guess it figures that Geryuon Ashbourne wouldn't set this up so it could all be solved in an instant with fortune-telling. Though I suppose we're still not sure if that killing was brought on by Geryuon himself."

Flue dropped to the floor and sat down with a tired sigh.

"That was exhausting."

As he spoke, he wiped the sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand.\
In reality, what he had done had taken the utmost concentration, which was reflected in Flue's complexion looking like he had just aged ten years. Naturally, this didn't happen every time he used magecraft. It was just that the barrier in the Castle of Separation was that powerful.
