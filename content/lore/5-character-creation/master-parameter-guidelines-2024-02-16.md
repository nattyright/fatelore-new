## Strength

**Rank E - Weak Human**

Rank E is for those who are below the average human in terms of strength. Be it because of an underdeveloped physique, a lack of activity, infirmity or disease, individuals in this group are physically weaker than most other humans, or even cannot effectively utilize strength at all.

**Rank D - Average Human**

Rank D is the domain of the ordinary. At this level one may be capable of crushing a can with their foot or lift heavy furniture with some effort. Not particularly healthy, but not particularly unhealthy either.

**Rank C - Above Average Human**

Rank C includes those that train regularly and keep in shape, whether the be as a hobby or due to the nature of one’s occupation. At this level one can reliably enter competitions and perform passably, and includes people that are part of a sports club or are in a position where they can perform physically demanding tasks, such as lifting heavy objects. People at this rank are physically fit, and in its upper reaches even includes those that have dedicated themselves to disciplined training, though they still fall short of true experts, whether that be due to lacking age or talent, or both.

**Rank B - Peak Human**

Rank B describes the pinnacle of human ability, or at the very least, natural human ability. This is the domain of olympic athletes and martial artists that have spent their whole life refining their techniques. At this level one is capable of performing incredible feats of strength that would be unheard of for most anybody else, and are confident to be unmatched in a contest of pure physical might. These are people that have honed themselves to the utmost.

**Rank A - Superhuman**

Rank A is ordinarily impossible to achieve by the human body alone, and is the domain only reachable by magical and alchemical enhancements. As such, though mages may have an inherent strength much weaker than this, they are still capable of achieving this rank via Reinforcement, tampering, or other alternative enhancements. At this level one is capable of shattering stone, tearing through wood, or inflict lethal wounds on an opponent with a single well-aimed strike. Combatants capable of comfortable operating at this level are fearsome indeed and usually belong to Executioners, Sealing Designation Enforcers, or other specialists, the upper limit for this Rank enough to hold one’s own even against Servants. At the lower this still includes ordinary mages too, those who perform rudimentary strengthening to leap over walls or dash at impossible speeds.

## Endurance

**Rank E - Feeble Human**

Rank E is for those who are deemed frail by normal human standards. People who get ill easily, look like they could get blown away by a gust of wind, or simply have low pain tolerance. They could simply be weak, or they could be someone who would be harmed by light exertion.

**Rank D - Average Human**

Rank D represents the standard human capacity to endure physical exertions and injury. Individuals at this level will tire from routine activities like running a short distance or engaging in moderate physical labor, like moving furniture around to redecorate their room. This rank includes those who lead peaceful uneventful lives that never exposed them to harsh trauma or injury. Bumping one’s knee will hurt, slap to the face will disorient, and any excessive pain is likely to cause one to lose consciousness.

**Rank C - Formidable Human**

Rank C includes those that regularly exercise, exposing their bodies to the satisfaction of hard work and the pain of muscle aches. This includes athletes engaged in regular training and individuals with demanding physical jobs. They can maintain physical activity for extended periods and are no strangers to work related injuries, or the many scrapes and cuts from spending a lot of time in the outdoors, having probably suffered from a pulled muscle, sprained ankle, or perhaps even an unluckily broken bone or two. Due to their body’s health they seldom get sick and are quick to heal from any injuries they may incur. Their tolerance for pain and adverse conditions is notably higher than that of an average person, even quite impressive at times.

**Rank B - Peak Human**

At Rank B one will encounter those pushing the limits of human endurance, most commonly soldiers having put through harsh conditioning to withstand even the most unforgiving conditions, star athletes that regularly bring their bodies to the brink, and warriors that have had more than one brush with death. This is the accumulation of years of effort, now rewarded with the ability to stave off fatigue and stress, refusing to be distracted in pursuit of their goal. At this level one’s body is sturdy and formidable, brimming with vitality and able to overcome great agony.

**Rank A - Superhuman**

This rank is beyond the natural human limit, attainable only through magical, alchemical, or other supernatural enhancements. Individuals at this level can withstand extreme temperatures, survive lethal injuries, and continue fighting despite critical conditions that would incapacitate a normal human. Their recovery from wounds is accelerated, often through magical means, making them formidable opponents in prolonged engagements.

## Agility

**Rank E - Slow Human**

Rank E is for those who lack in terms of speed to other humans, be it in terms of physical speed or reflexes and hand-eye coordination. People who are slow to react to the events surrounding them, or whose jog is as slow as another’s walk. This can also include those who are purposefully slow because of their own abilities or Magecraft, or those who cannot move at all and lack sufficient outside aid.

**Rank D - Average Human**

Rank D represents the standard human capacity for movement and reflexes. Individuals at this level can perform everyday tasks at a comfortable pace, and may or may not accidentally knock over their glass when wiping down their table. Their reaction time is average, allowing them to catch or dodge thrown objects in view, but those thrown with violent intent may prove a challenge to intercept reliably. This rank includes most people who live routine, ordinary lives.

**Rank C - Formidable Human**

Individuals with Rank C Agility commonly engage in activities that improve their reflexes and coordination, such as sports or training. They can execute movements with impressive speed and precision and react quickly to unexpected surprises. They are more likely to outrun a purse-snatcher than fall prey to their ill-intent.

**Rank B - Peak Human**

Rank B is the pinnacle of human agility, where individuals exhibit extraordinary speed, reflexes, and coordination. This level is dominated by professional athletes and expert martial artists who can perform awe-inspiring feats, dodge attacks with minimal movement, and strike with incredible precision. Their reaction times are significantly faster than the average human, allowing them to respond instantaneously to threats or opportunities even if reacting slightly late to an attack.

**Rank A - Superhuman**

Beyond the natural limits. Rank A Agility is achieved through supernatural means, such as magic or advanced technology. Individuals at this level can move at speeds that blur to the human eye, perform leaps and maneuvers that defy physics, and react to events so fast that one might mistake it for natural instinct. Their movements are fluid and precise, enabling them to navigate through chaotic battlefields with ease or evade attacks targeted at them from multiple opponents.

## Mana

**Rank E - Failure of a Magus**

Those who possess poor Magic Circuits, and either because of genetics, incidents, or sheer bad luck, have a very poor aptitude for Magecraft. Their circuits cannot withstand the stress of casting most Magecraft, and they usually have limited mana to work with. They might not even be aware of their body’s capability to perform Magecraft, because of how underdeveloped and restrictive their own circuits are.

**Rank D - Potential Magus**

Those who possess healthy, serviceable Magic Circuits, even if they possibly lack the means to process it. This Rank also includes those born with the capacity to do magecraft yet were never taught or lacked the ability to develop their talents, but it is usually more likely that those at this level are oblivious to magecraft entirely. Despite their lack of knowledge, however, the potential is still there to learn.

**Rank C - Average Magus**

Rank C encompasses most early students of magecraft, those with a solid grasp on the fundamentals while still lacking the ability to perform more complex spells without assistance. Though one may know the process in theory, the practice of it may be difficult to execute when even the conversion and production of magical energy requires some degree of effort. It is possible to have mastered a straight-forward spell or two and have already chosen a preference for a specific field of magecraft aligned with one’s attribute. At higher levels one may encounter a competent mage showing great promise, though nurturing such talent still requires time, effort, and perseverance.

**Rank B - Superior Magus**

Rank B is usually attained by those that have graduated from the Clocktower, or those with the ability to stand toe-to-toe with them, perhaps even surpass them depending on their thaumaturgical foundation. Continued practice and repetition is often not enough, and a certain degree of luck is near essential to ensure one is born with sufficient quantity and quality of magic circuits to facilitate one’s spellcraft. This Rank ranges from graduates that have proven excellence, to those simply born gifted, and even includes the rare mage who has gone above and beyond to refine their gift to the utmost.

**Rank A - Masterful Magus**

Pushing the boundary of what is possible, and unattainably by those not born with the potential. This Tier of mages may not necessarily be composed of those that studiously adhered to their teachings, as this is the realm of the abnormal. Those born with twisted Origins, possessed of unnatural Mystic Eyes, or even those whose essence has been magically altered by phantasmal entities. While it is still possible for ‘ordinary’ mages to reach this level if particularly gifted, the ability to remain ordinary at this level of magical excellence is in itself an oddity. More often than not, those that have attained this Rank did so by bending a few rules.
