# Character Guidelines

Players are advised to follow the listed Guidelines. Characters that are unjustifiably edgy, simplistic, or whose exaggerated or lacking character traits otherwise do not contribute to creating a compelling character will most likely be rejected. There are ways of incorporating extreme character traits of course, but doing so requires care, attention, and balance, and such effort is usually rewarded with much more memorable characters.

Additionally, please keep in mind that no pure Gods, Divine Spirits, or Pseudo Servants are allowed as characters on this server. The natural exceptions to this rule are demigods or Divine Servants that were once mortal, lost their divinity, or gained it over the course of their life. The most notable example of this would be Heracles.

# Ability Guidelines

In addition to the above, a character's abilities too are subject to rules and guidelines. The abilities listed down below are seen as controversial and easy to be abused, and while most of them are present in the original Fate canon and are thus proven to be valid and feasible, there is a stark difference between a narrative you are solely in control over, and a shared collaborative narrative experience. The ability to kill somebody in a single hit may ordinarily set up interesting stakes for the main character to overcome, but in a roleplay, there is nothing stopping anybody from simply using that ability each and every time one encounters an obstacle.

Our main philosophy when it comes to abilities is the following:

**We do not condone any abilities that rob somebody else of their agency or freedom.**

Abilities that actively encourage power and meta-gaming to any degree are likewise extremely likely to be rejected. Overall, we try our best to approve a wide variety of abilities, but will show no mercy when it comes to abilities that are too heavily weighted towards oneself, because at that point you are, whether intentionally or not, disregarding and disrespecting your partner and offering them a negative experience.

Therefore it is recommended to avoid making abilities that fit under this description. 

Please note that you are technically still allowed to make characters with such abilities, considering how far to the extreme they lean on the spectrum. But if you fail to balance that ability properly despite all of the warnings given above, do not be surprised if your Sheet is rejected if you are asked to alter the nature of your character's abilities.

1. Instant kill or nuke abilities.
2. Abilities that act as perfect counters to specific traits must be clearly defined and have room for counterplay. For instance, a dragon-slaying skill that allows you to deal additional damage against them is fine, but one that kills them instantly is not. An Anti-Divinity skill that gives you extra defenses against the Divine is fine, but one that makes you immune to all damage from Divine sources is not. These skills should also be backed up in writing and an integral part of your character's characterization. If your character is an expert at fighting certain types of opponents, then that should be reflected in how they act, think and behave. Please do not treat these attributes as free damage modifiers, and instead consider them as additional tools to flesh out your character's personality.
3. Abilities that buff or debuff other character's abilities must have clear limitations and restrictions.
4. Abilities that grant a character access to various other abilities for the price of one, such as Imperial Privilege, Inherent Wisdom, etc.
5. Abilities that “make the impossible possible”, such as Pioneer of the Stars, must be clearly defined in how they work, and have clear limits. If the description is too vague, staff will deny it outright.
6. No mind control or charm abilities that can control other player characters that are not your own without consent. If you still want to submit these abilities, you must add a consent clause, in which players who do not wish to play with such effects instead receive an alternate lesser debuff.
7. No abilities that grant omniscience or omnipotence, such as Sha Naqba Imuru or high ranks of Clairvoyance.
8. Time Manipulation and Time Control abilities are allowed, but must be balanced extremely well to be considered for approval. Anything that breaks the rules above will be met with an instant rejection. Do not be surprised if your sheet gets rejected for having Time Manipulation, since it’s a very tricky ability to handle correctly.

**Note:** This list should be considered a Living Document. Do not be surprised if more abilities are added or removed from the list, nor should you consider the absence of a similarly controversial ability as a sign that it is allowed.

Additionally, we reserve the right to deny any abilities that we think lack the required depth and detail to justify their effect. Shoddily or insufficiently explained abilities often create problems in a roleplaying environment, especially so in combat. If your Sheet is denied for this reason, we ask that you further elaborate on your abilities.
