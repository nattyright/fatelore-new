title: Neo Holy Empire
weight: 50
---
Like in the original *Fate/Stay Night*, the Holy Church is an organization that specializes in the hunting of heresy and demons. Being a subsection of the Roman Catholic Church, it works from the shadows through zealots known as Executors and agents of the Burial Agency. They have a tenuous relationship with the Mage’s Association and are also known to monitor Holy Grail Wars as impartial and unbiased judges, albeit there have been rumours of them favouring certain sides over the other.

Unfortunately, like any other large organization in the world, the Holy Church crumbled and split off in the face of the apocalypse. The Grail Mud destroyed its base, and its unique miracles could not save it. Numerous holy relics were lost and the pope was reported missing once the Grail Mud submerged the entirety of Rome.

However, some of the agents of the Holy Church saw warning signs of the impending apocalypse. Rejecting the orders of the pope, they split off the Holy Church in advance and started roaming the world once the apocalypse started. Eventually, they came across a prophet. A ‘messiah’ that would lead them to salvation…

The messiah gathered more followers, and the former agents of the church assisted them in their endeavours. Eventually, the Holy Church would be reborn as the **Neo Holy Empire**, an organization that calls itself the spiritual successor to the Holy Church from 100 years ago. 

# Influence

Being founded around a few decades after the apocalypse, this new organization focused on gathering researchers, scientists and traders, but most importantly, devout people who were willing to follow the Lord. They advertised themselves as an organization seeking to archive and preserve the traditions of old, such as numerous religions ranging from Christianity to Hinduism and Buddhism.

While the majority of its members are still Catholic, the sheer amount of variety in Holy Scriptures has turned it into a peaceful, accepting community that has gathered almost as many members as the Roman Catholic Church in its prime. In the year 2104, the Neo Holy Empire is rumoured to control at least **3 Stella Maris cities**, while also having several smaller cities under its protection and guidance. Its relationships with other cities is amicable at best and neutral at worst, but the organization seems to have a distaste for remnants of the Mage’s Association.

The Church has perpetuated a society where Servants are seen as workers more than fighters. Servants are tasked to obey their Masters, lest their contract be ended via Command Seals. Black markets are also fairly rare in Church controlled cities, due to the presence of Executors who also act as the Church’s enforcers and local police force. Due to this, the Neo Holy Empire gathers most of its Holy Grail data from wars happening in other cities.

**Facilities**

The Church has state of the art science labs, along with numerous archives containing articles, research papers, books and tomes from centuries ago. The Church has attempted to archive all traditions and remnants of the Old World, in order to preserve its culture and allow others to be enlightened by the knowledge of the past while simultaneously pursuing the new. It is not surprising that it has attracted so many people under its care as a result, since numerous researchers have joined the Neo Holy Empire because of the facilities alone. Being devout is nonessential, since the Church knows it cannot be picky.

# Magecraft & Tech

The Neo Holy Empire, much like the Holy Church before it, abhors the use of Magecraft, considering it to be something that borders on heresy. Members of the Neo Holy Empire are forbidden from utilizing or learning Magecraft, but they are allowed to learn the Church’s own brand of magic, also known as ‘**miracles**’ and ‘**baptism rites**’. Unlike Magecraft, which focuses on affecting the physical world, miracles focus on affecting the spiritual world. Therefore, they are incredibly effective at exorcising demons and evil spirits. They are also very effective against Servants, since their Spirit Origin cores are so fragile in a S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Mystic Code that an Executor trained in the art of miracles could probably harm them far easier than any other mage. Magic Resistance skills still apply, however.

The Church instead places a bigger faith on technology, and one could say that most of the new world’s technological advancements are owed to the Church. Its Stella Maris cities are connected to one another via an intricate transport system that is fully powered by traditional means and devoid of Magecraft. The cities themselves are glorious technological megapolises inhabited by some of the greatest researchers of the time period. The only Magecraft present inside the cities are Sea Runes dedicated to letting them float, but the Church has kept this underwraps by claiming that it is a miracle instead.

The Neo Holy Empire also takes advantage of S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Mystic Codes quite often. Due to the lack of Magecraft, most of the cities’ infrastructure was actually made with the assistance of Servants. Even now, Servants are considered to be the heart and soul of cities controlled by the Neo Holy Empire, and are given better rights due to their importance to the Church. However, they are still scorned and treated as second class citizens by most humans, causing some resentment to flow in the city’s darker areas.

Those who are under the Neo Holy Empire’s protection are not encouraged to utilize Magecraft either. However, the Church does not condemn them for using Magecraft to survive, such as if the city they are protecting requires ley lines to allow public transport to function and so on. Its bias towards Magecraft is, however, abundantly clear.

# Mission & Goal

1. The Neo Holy Empire has four main goals in its doctrine:
2. Retrieve the lost holy relics that were dispersed in the apocalypse.
3. Oversee all manners of potential Holy Grail Wars and act as an impartial judge if given the chance to do so.
4. Host Holy Grail Wars during specific seasons in the year.
5. Recover 100% of the Holy Grail’s data.

Due to these goals, the Neo Holy Empire is very interested in the numerous Holy Grail Wars that have erupted since the apocalypse started. It has been closely monitoring HGWs happening in minor cities via its Executors, who have now been repurposed as scouts and overseers of Holy Grail Wars.

Data obtained by the Executors is then filtered back to researchers located at the Church’s capital. The Neo Holy Empire aims to use the numerous Holy Grail Wars as a way to reverse engineer the Grail’s data by seeing it in action numerous times. So far, they have monitored around a hundred or more Holy Grail Wars, each one differing in size and being located in different cities.

However, the reward for such devotion has been minimal. In the span of around a hundred years since the apocalypse happened, the Church has only managed to gather around 10% of the Holy Grail’s data via monitoring alone. As such, they are currently working on an alternative method to gather data on the Holy Grail, but that relies on the assistance of Republic.

The Neo Holy Empire is ruled by various archbishops and popes, but its main leader is an enigmatic figure known as the Pater Patriae. Not much is known about them, besides that the inner sects respect them deeply and that their orders are usually absolute.

# Relationships

Despite being an amicable organization that has helped many, the Neo Holy Empire currently has a neutral stance towards Republic. Being an organization that utilizes Servants more than Magecraft, the Church tried its best to appeal to Republic and form an alliance with them. However, attempts to contact Republic seemed futile, as the Neo Holy Empire received radio silence for the most part. Eventually, Republic gave in and replied, only to give a rather blunt message.

*“Republic is currently not interested in forming any business partnerships with the Holy Church. If you require customer assistance, please contact our Customer Service hotline instead.”*

The audacity behind that message was enough to infuriate most of the higher-ups in the Church. However, the Neo Holy Empire’s leader ordered the organization to stand down and to keep an amicable relationship with Republic. Their word was enough for the others to quiet down, as they resumed their activities instead and ignored Republic.

However, this was a huge blow to the Church, for the reason they contacted Republic was due to them wanting to obtain the 10% Holy Grail Data that was used in the production of S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Mystic Codes. While the Church has obtained their own 10% of data, it is a different category than what Republic obtained, and one could say that their two fragments of data serve two different purposes.



# The Four Heavenly Generals

The Neo Holy Empire, the kingdom of the Church, is the pinnacle of organisation in the new world. With both great influence and great territory, they boast several Stella Maris cities under their domain as well as many smaller ones, a feat that the other factions could only dream of. Through uniting all beliefs, religions, and creeds under one banner, it also grants peace to those who stand beneath it.

But peace is as fleeting as the waves of the sea. An illusion carefully maintained through proper management and care. Left unattended, a perfect garden will grow weeds, and an empire is no different. A vigilant gardener can maintain their manor grounds with some effort, but what about an entire national park? One man can only do so much. That is why the Church’s leader needed vassals.

But who? Who to entrust such an important task? Who to trust with the wellbeing of hundreds of thousands? Humans were flawed, fickle and self-interested, a critic made apparent by thousands of years of history, written in the ink of revolution and tyranny. That is why the Church’s leader turned to those who had already proven themselves, calling upon four great Servants of the past with notable Spirit Origins. 

`One would govern science and healthcare. `

`One would govern outer politics and peacekeeping.`

`One would govern industrialisation and architecture.`

`One would govern war and expansion.`

These four, the Four Heavenly Generals, were the arms of the Church, overseeing the entirety of the Neo Holy Empire. To see entire cities of humans governed by servants is odd, but not only do the citizens have complete trust in them, they could not oppose them even if they wanted to. The will of the Church’s leader is absolute, and to disagree with the Heavenly Generals is to disagree with the entirety of the Church, those who seek the best for their subjects, and those who have proven their merit time and time again. 

To disagree with such a thing is foolishness, nothing more.





# Executors

## Hierarchy

Roughly 1000 executors operate worldwide at any given time. However, it’s important to note that `not all of them bear the full qualifications associated with the title`. Only a small handful of them can genuinely be recognized as fully qualified executors.

Below is a general breakdown of their internal structure:

**Official executors:** `10%` <br>
**Bodyguards for distinguished church personnel:** `10%` <br>
**Instructors & scouts for promising executor candidates:** `20%` <br>
**Law enforcement:** `60%`

## Background

**Executor Candidates**

Each year, the Church takes in talented kids from all over the world and raises them to become Executor Candidates. These kids are usually no older than 3 years of age, too young to develop long-term memory, but have already shown remarkable aptitude in sports or other physical activities. After separating them from their parents, the kids are then divided into groups of 21 and sent to a few Dhruva type cities that were specially constructed to accommodate their training regimen.

From there on, these Executor Candidates are immediately put into training along with their new ‘siblings’. Their training menu is rigorous and painful, with them being taught various martial arts, baptism rites and weapons by instructors and former executors. Mastery of all of these arts is required for an Executor Candidate to proceed in their training.

During their downtime, depending on the city that houses them, their daily lives could range anywhere from a boarding school lifestyle to downright militaristic. However, one thing remains the same across all cities: various priests and nuns would visit each of them in rotation, teaching the kids general studies and religious studies that are deemed most beneficial to developing their **faith**.

The training would last until they are 17 years of age.

**The Entrance Exam**

Each year, the Church would hold a rigorous, multi-course tournament for all Executor Candidates who have finished their training. Of them all, the top 21 scorers who have shown exceptional aptitude are then chosen to enter the **University** to further their training and become full-fledged Executors. 

The Executor Candidates who fail to make the cut would instead become **law enforcement officials** for various Church-affiliated cities.

**The University**

Four more years of training awaits the Executor Candidates who passed the ‘entrance exam’. The training usually consists of a lot more field work than before, with a sprinkle of magecraft lessons thrown into the mix under the guise of baptism rites. The University’s ranking system grades each Executor Candidate on three metrics: their **physical skills**, **proficiency in performing ‘miracles’**, and **faith**.

The training is not without accidents. By the time 4 years have passed, it wouldn’t be unusual for a class size of 21 to dwindle to only 13 or 14. Nonetheless, the surviving Executor Candidates would have completed their course. 

**The Final Test**

Before they can graduate, Executor Candidates are given a final exam that allows no retakes. Executor Candidates who pass this exam are baptized to be Official Executors and are now legally allowed to commence their service in field operations. Executors who fail are instead demoted to bodyguards for important personnel, or tasked to be teachers/scouts of new promising Executor Candidates.

## Codenames 

Official Executors, along with other high ranking officials, use pasta names as codenames on the job because the admins say so and you can’t convince us otherwise.

[Here’s a list of pasta names to help you get started :)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_pasta)

## Holy Mystic Code

A ceremony is held for each class of Executor Candidates upon entering the University. At the ceremony, each of them would receive a Holy Mystic Code, in the form of a cross-shaped tattoo, on their chest. 

The Mystic Code enables them to activate a bounded field that can store a number of weapons and artifacts, so long as they have been branded by the Church. 

Additionally, depending on their occupation, other high ranking Church members are also branded with the Holy Mystic Code.

## Command Spells

At the University, Executor Candidates **who have scored extremely high on all 3 metrics** are admitted to a special program that grants them access to Command Spells, something the Church has been meaning to keep under wraps.

The process of procuring these Command Spells is gruesome and downright cruel. Since the only way to generate Command Spells is via the summoning of Servants through the Church’s brand of S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frames, the only way to harvest said Command Spells is by repeated summoning and slaughtering of (weaker) Servants before they could kill their Masters.

The long-term implications of such combat exposure remain to be seen.

Of course, an easier alternative would be to expend a Command Spell and force a Servant to commit suicide. However, statistics have shown that due to the lack of data inside each S.E.R.V.A.N.T. core, it would take 2 or even all 3 Command Spells to ensure the erasure of a Servant before they could retaliate, which renders the process fruitless.

Due to the strict screening process and all the risks involved, the number of Executor Candidates who know of this procedure and, subsequently, carry Command Spells on them are far and few between.

Occasionally, Executors who have graduated come back to replenish their Command Spells as well.

## Dress Code

Executors’ uniforms are all tailored at Church-affiliated cities. Each uniform may be customized depending on an Executor’s preferences, but they must not cover the center of their chest, where the Holy Mystic Code is tattooed, lest they let the fabric interfere with the Mystic Code’s functions. (Boob windows. Take it or leave it.)

The color palette of each uniform is black with white accents. Accessories are permitted so long as they don’t get in the way of combat.

## RP Help

The most important takeaways from this section are:

1. All Executor Candidates are taken in to be raised in curated environments at a really young age. Unlike characters from other sects, Executor Candidates have no reason to remember their real parents, or any conflict that may have occurred prior to their new life. If they do, then they will have been dropped out of the training system. If you wish to create a Church faction member who ‘secretly harbors hate or discontent for the Church’, then the Executor role may not be for you.
2. As an addendum to #1, please think carefully about how this curated lifestyle may shape your Executor’s mind and body. The specifics on each training city is left vague on purpose, but please exercise common sense when coming up with your Executor’s backstory.
3. Faith is an important metric in ranking Executor Candidates at the University. However, even Executor Candidates with a low faith ranking are **completely loyal to the Church and will always act in its best interests. There is more lore behind this behavior**. If you wish to create a Church faction member who ‘secretly wants to sabotage the Church’, then the Executor role may not be for you. 

How does low faith come into play then? 

Executors with low faith may exhibit erratic behavior, complain more, or have normal-ish values and morals compared to Executors with high faith. However, no matter what they do or what they think and no matter how you may need to write crack to justify yourself IRP, they still place the utmost trust in the Church and will not doubt the Church under any circumstances.

# Executors in Roleplay

*Currently, we do not accept full-fledged executors (the 10%) as roleplayable characters. Only executors in name only, such as trainees, bodyguards, instructors, law enforcements and church officials that take up other roles within the NHE are accepted.*

## Optional Items
{{< hint "info" >}}
### Reinforced Uniform (Optional)

*This item is optional. If your character carries it, it will take up a C rank item slot.*

**Item Name:** Reinforced Uniform

**Rank:** C

**Type:** Mystic Code (Church)

**Description:** Reinforcement magecraft has been worked into the fabric, providing protection against physical and mental harm.

*Unless completely vaporized, the uniform can be mended while out of combat. A Church operator is also permitted to carry multiple changes of the uniform while on remote duty.*

All Church operator uniforms follow a simple color scheme of black and white. Accents are permitted so long as they don’t occupy more than 10% of the fabric. All operators have the option to have their uniform tailor made to taste. Otherwise, the standardized version is offered.

**Functions:**
- Offers partial insulation to attacks ranked D and below.
- Offers minimal insulation to attacks ranked C and above.

The above applies to both Mage and Servant stats/skills equally, as the Church’s extensive study on Servants grants it an edge when producing anti-Servant techwear. Any damage that passes through will need additional insulation via your character’s Reinforcement skill, weapon, or other means.

{{< hint "info" >}}
### S.E.R.V.A.N.T. Frame Decoder (Optional)

*This item is optional. If your character carries it, it will take up a C rank item slot.*

**Item Name:** Varies. See `Naming Scheme` at the end.

**Rank:** C

**Type:** Mystic Code (Church)

**Description:** All Church weapons have a flat C across all parameters, including durability. Against non-Servants, they behave like your average C-ranked Mystic Codes, with varying functions that are dependent on each weapon’s design.

*This weaspon can be broken. Once broken, it cannot be repaired or reissued unless it has been taken back to NHE HQ.*

An additional functionality is unlocked when certain conditions are met:
- the Church operator has the reinforcement skill at `rank A`
- the weapon is used against a Servant and manages to land a successful hit.

When the above conditions are met and fueled by a Church operator’s mana, these weapons become powerful tranquilizers that are able to partially paralyze a Servant upon direct contact with their S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frame. 

**Area of Effect:** A well-placed shot will paralyze the target area of impact and a small surrounding radius. For instance, striking a limb, a portion of the torso, or the head will cause paralysis or a stunning effect in the immediate area.

**Duration:** A few seconds at most.

**Cost:** Equivalent to using your character's Trump Card.

**Naming Scheme:** All Church weapons adopt the following naming convention:

`Mxxx [Prototype] [Bird name] [Make]`

- M = Miracle
- xxx = The year of production. The holy empire marks 2004 as the new genesis. As such, 2004 = 000, 2005 = 001…and so on.
- [prototype] = optional tag for weapons in testing
- Bird name = A bird species. Birds of prey are preferred.
- Make = version number.

**Example:**

M100 Prototype Bateleur Mk-I = a prototype weapon on its 1st version and designed/produced in year 2104 (100th year)

A list of approved Church weapons can be found here: [TBD, a list of taken bird names.]
